## Car Recommendation Engine

A hybrid machine learning-based Car Recommendation System that combines supervised and unsupervised learning models to provide personalized car suggestions. The app is built with Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

## Project Overview
This project uses both classification and clustering techniques to recommend cars based on user preferences and data patterns. Key models used include:

Supervised Learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic regression and Random Forest classifier.

Unsupervised Learning models: K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Agglomerative Clustering

# Streamlit cloud deployed App

## Jupyter notebook

The Project is done on the kaggle and here's my notebook link. To run the code, run the notebook on kaggle along with the datasets mentioned above.

- [Milestone1 IDS Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rohithballem/ids-milestone1)

- The notebook is also present under the "Scripts" folder

- For milestone 2 and 3 developed in local jupyter notebook and uploaded as .ipynb files only.
